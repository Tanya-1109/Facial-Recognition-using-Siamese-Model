# Facial-Recognition-using-Siamese-Model

#### We will build this model according to Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition, the link for the paper is [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf]

#### The Google Colab will not let us use webcam for capturing the images so we can run the code on our local machines, capture the data and then upload it. 

#### The details and related information regarding how we built this model and step by step architecture is explained in the notebook itself.

#### The main idea is simple. Here is the architecture.
